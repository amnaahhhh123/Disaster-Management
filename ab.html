    <h1>Aim of the Disaster Management Project</h1>
    <p>The primary aim of this project is to develop a web-based Disaster Management System that facilitates volunteer registration and real-time alert notifications for individuals located near disaster-prone areas. The system will serve as a centralized platform for coordinating disaster response efforts, ensuring timely communication, and mobilizing volunteers effectively.</p>

    <p>Key Objectives:</p>  
    <p> 1-Volunteer Registration: Allow individuals to register as volunteers by submitting their details and skills related to disaster management.</p> 
    <p> 2- Real-time Alerts: Notify users near disaster-affected areas about potential dangers and necessary precautions.</p> 
    <p> 3- Disaster Information: Provide the latest updates, instructions, and safety guidelines related to different types of disasters.</p> 
    <p> 4- User Accessibility: A responsive web interface with a login system and a left-side menu for easy navigation.</p> 
    <p> 5-Automated Notifications: Use location-based services (geolocation API) to identify users close to disaster zones and send relevant alerts.</p> 
        This project aims to enhance disaster preparedness and response efforts, ensuring faster mobilization of resources and better coordination among volunteers and authorities.
