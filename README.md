### Project Description
The Disaster Management System is a web-based platform designed to facilitate volunteer registration and provide real-time alert notifications to individuals near disaster-prone areas. It helps in coordinating disaster response efforts by ensuring timely communication, mobilizing volunteers, and providing crucial safety information.

### The Problem statement
Disasters, both natural and man-made, often lead to chaos due to the lack of timely communication, uncoordinated volunteer efforts, and inefficient resource mobilization. People in affected areas may not receive real-time alerts, leading to increased casualties and damages. Additionally, there is no centralized system to register and manage volunteers effectively.

### The Solution
The Disaster Management System provides a centralized web platform that enhances disaster preparedness and response through:

Volunteer Registration: Allows individuals to register, specifying their skills to assist in disaster relief efforts efficiently.
Real-time Alerts: Uses geolocation services to notify users near disaster-prone areas about potential threats and safety measures.
Disaster Information Hub: Provides the latest news, safety guidelines, and emergency instructions to help communities stay informed.
Automated Notifications: Sends location-based alerts to affected individuals, ensuring quick and efficient communication.
